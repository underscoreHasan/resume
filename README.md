# Resume [here](https://underscorehasan.github.io/resume/resume.pdf)! ðŸ“œ

Deployment workflow based on [jonhue/pubtex](https://github.com/jonhue/pubtex)

This repo publicly hosts a LaTeX file for my Resume on GitHub Pages.

It roughly works as follows:

- The LaTeX file is written as normal.
- Whenever changes are pushed to main, the LaTeX file is compiled to a PDF and pushed to the gh-pages branch.
- The gh-pages branch is then published by the default GitHub Pages workflow!
