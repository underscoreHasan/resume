# Resume [here](https://underscorehasan.github.io/resume/resume.pdf)! ðŸ“œ

I have successfully managed to overengineer my resume

Deployment workflow based on [jonhue/pubtex](https://github.com/jonhue/pubtex)

This repo publicly hosts a LaTeX file for my Resume on GitHub Pages.

It roughly works as follows:

- The LaTeX file is written as normal.
- Whenever changes are pushed to `main`, the LaTeX file is compiled to a PDF and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.
- The `gh-pages` branch is then published by the default GitHub Pages workflow!
